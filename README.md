# Basic Staking Platform

## 1. Project Title
Basic Staking Platform

## 2. Project Description
The Basic Staking Platform is a minimal smart contract built using the Clarity language.  
It allows users to stake their STX tokens into the contract and view their staked balance.  
This version contains only two core functions for demonstration and learning purposes.

## 3. Project Vision
To provide a foundation for building staking applications on the Stacks blockchain,  
starting with a simple two-function contract and expanding into a fully-featured staking system.

## 4. Future Scope
- **Unstaking Mechanism**: Allow users to withdraw their staked tokens.
- **Rewards System**: Implement a reward distribution logic based on staking time and amount.
- **Multiple Token Support**: Enable staking of fungible tokens (SIP-010).
- **Lock Periods**: Introduce fixed staking periods for higher rewards.
- **Admin Controls**: Add features for managing staking parameters.

## 5. Contract Address
*To be updated after deployment to the Stacks blockchain.*
