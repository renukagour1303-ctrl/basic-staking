It allows users to stake their STX tokens into the contract and view their staked balance.  
This version contains only two core functions for demonstration and learning purposes.

To provide a foundation for building staking applications on the Stacks blockchain,  
starting with a simple two-function contract and expanding into a fully-featured staking system.

## 4. Future Scope
- **Unstaking Mechanism**: Allow users to withdraw their staked tokens.
- **Rewards System**: Implement a reward distribution logic based on staking time and amount.
- **Multiple Token Support**: Enable staking of fungible tokens (SIP-010).
- **Lock Periods**: Introduce fixed staking periods for higher rewards.
- **Admin Controls**: Add features for managing staking parameters.
